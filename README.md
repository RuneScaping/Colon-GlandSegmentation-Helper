# Colon-GlandSegmentation-Helper
This project assists in the process of gland segmentation in colon histology images as part of the GlaS Challenge Contest.

# Setup and Execution
1. Download the data from the Glas Challange Contest page and organize it into a ./data/train and ./data/test folder

2. Execute data.py which generates the binary versions of the data

3. Run train.py to load and train the model, execute predictions, and save results.

Running visualize.py provides the capability to iterate through results on the test set.

# Sample Results
Checkout sample results in the sample-results folder of this repository. Contributions from RuneScaping are welcome.
